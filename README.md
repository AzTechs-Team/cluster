# Cluster
Community portal for university 

### Motivation
The main problem statement we want to address is that university events and communities are not utilized to the fullest by students. 
Our aim is to reduce this issue by creating a one-stop platform to get all details about university events, community, or otherwise.
This will encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and get involved in more extracurricular activities.
